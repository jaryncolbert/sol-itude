## About
> “In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of
    the work.” -- Sol LeWitt

This project was inspired
by the work of Conceptualism pioneer
[Solomon "Sol" LeWitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/arts/design/09lewitt.html).

Sol worked with various media,
but this project explores his [wall drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/),
where each piece is defined
by a set of instructions
that are left open to interpretation
by other artists that execute the works.

Because of the collaborative nature of these wall drawings,
Sol LeWitt's works may appear very different from each other,
even for the same set of instructions.
This project randomizes the ambiguous properties of each drawing
to explore the constraints of each work.
